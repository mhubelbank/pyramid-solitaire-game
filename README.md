#### Authored by user @mhubelbank.

This repo contains the source code, tests, and gampeplay images of a Java terminal-based [pyramid solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(solitaire)) game. This project was an individual submission for the object-oriented design class (CS3500) at Northeastern University.

This implementation went through a couple iterations of development as I modified my central design to satisfy new functional requirements. This was a hard-earned lesson on the importance of writing extensible, future-proof software. My final solution uses the model-view-controller design pattern, adheres to the SOLID design principles, and is tested thorougly using the JUnit framework.
